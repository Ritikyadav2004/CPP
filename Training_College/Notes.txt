(>>)-->exertion operator.
(::) scope resolution operator.
0-->success,chal gya to chla gya, also tell about the ending of excution of program.
namespce-->it used to  access the glbal varible.
#-->tell about this is a pre processor.
DATA TYPE    
smallest datatype charatcer inc++ is char value 1 byte.
bool is of 1 byte storage.
int contain 2 datatype integer and char integer have 4byte and char have 1 byte.
we can also shirt the intger data type by aadding sort int--> automatticaly it is off 2byte.
long have 8byte (these are the intger dat type).
we can not store fractional value.
for that we use float and double.
float is of 4 byte and double of 8 byte.
by wrtitng "long long long" it automatically increase the size of data
1 BYte gave  8 bit and 1 bit.
if i put all box 1 in 8 bit [ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  ] maxiumum number 255
2 ki power n --->goes to 1-7.
data type .
IMP THING
computer represnt sigend numbers with the help of the first bit
(MSB(most significant bit)).BY looking at this bit the computer understande whether a number is positve or -tiv.
A 0 in the MSB indicate postive number , a 1 at MSB denotes Negative number.s

        PERFORMANCE MATRICS OF SORTING ALGORITHM
    1. Best Case Time Complexity O(n^2) -> after modification 0(n):
    2. Wosrt Case Time Complexity  O(n^2)
    3. Adaptibility : When the Best Case Time complexity and Wosrt Case Time  Complexity are Equal
                    :(When1<2) - it is Adaptable with slight
    4. Stability : When the Respective postion of equal elemnt is unchanged That type of of
                :Sorting is called stable sorting.
                :Stbility mean maintaining the orignal order of Equal elemnt.
                :Bubble sorting is a stable type of sorting
                :Jo pahele 'A' likha he vo pahale SOrt hoga 
                :example Ayush and Abhisekh aysuh sort hoga 1st

SELECTION SORTING:

in Selection sort the smallest elemnt is found from an array and placed at the
fisrt position ,2nd smallest at the 2nd positoj and 3rd smallest in the 3rd position
and so on

eg: | 0  | | 1 | | 2 | 3 | | 4  | | 5 | 

   :| 10 | | 5 | | 7 | 6 | | 12 | | 9 |
